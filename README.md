## Overview
Planning trips to the U.S. National Parks is surprisingly difficult for travelers due to fragmented information across multiple websites and the lack of systematic comparison tools. In this project, we developed an interactive R Shiny application that combines multiple domains of information to enable intuitive exploration and comparison across parks. The app further supports travelers by helping them identify parks that best align with their travel needs and preferences.

## Key Features of the Project

**National Park Summarization**: Generate state-level summary statistics using multiple datasets from National Park Service (NPS) and build an interactive park map.

**Park Grouping System**: Implement k-means clustering to reveal natural groupings among parks, helping users discover comparable alternatives they might not have considered.

**Recommendation System**: Develop a recommendation system that accounts for both user preferences and park popularity, allowing travelers to balance personal interests with popular destinations.

**An App that Unifies Information**: Build an intuitive and user-friendly R Shiny app to visulize the results, enabling flexible and efficient exploration of national parks and providing informed travel decisions.
